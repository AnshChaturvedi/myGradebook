# myGradebook

One of my first personal projects using SqliteDB, Python, Flask, HTML/CSS and a touch of JavaScript to create a personalized gradebook! Users can register for an account, log in (passwords are hashed using SHA256) and view their current grades, giving them the functionality to add grades, remove grades, and calculate important benchmarks like averages, mean and more!
