This project of mine is a gradebook, but specifically for the International Baccalaureate program. I chose to do this project mainly because I am in the program myself and understand the difficulties we face when it comes to marks and keeping track of them for later use and amelioration in our courses. The gradebook supports multiple users, and stores data of courses, its assignment name, the IB grade as well as the raw grade.
